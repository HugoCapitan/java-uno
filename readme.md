# Java UNO.

Small uno game written in java to learn by doing.

Not sure if fun or frustrating since all the other players will be able to see your cards bc I don't know how to make it internet friendly yet.

## TODOs:

- Handle when someone wins
- Remove letters of cards just eaten by effect of a draw card (since these are not playable the first time they are displayed).
- Handle printing two rows of cards.
- Find more usable way of displaying help.
- Discuss if keep 'pass' option.
- Implement cursor for playing cards, move the arrows to move between cards and press enter to select and play.
- Implement LAN mode!
